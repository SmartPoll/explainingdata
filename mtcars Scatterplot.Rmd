library(ggplot2)

# Create chart
ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.25, color = 'blue') + theme(legend.position="none") + ggtitle("Scatterplot of the relationship between a car's horsepower (x) and (miles per gallon (y)") + xlab("Horsepower (hp)") + ylab("Miles per gallon (mpg)") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + xlim(0, 400) + ylim(0, 35)
